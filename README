Required to create the graphs: 
   
   Graphing lib: gnuplot  
   perl        : Chart::Gnuplot

Before starting you need to build libev and libevent and install them in ./lib

  ./build_event_libs.sh
  make clean; make all
  ./bench.pl
  ./create_charts.pl

The bench script should take a long time. Have a play around with it to see
what it does.

You can find the graphs in ./graphs along with a basic index.html file. If you 
craete different graphs the HTML file is not updated so you need to add them.
